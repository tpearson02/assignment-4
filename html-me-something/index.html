            <h3> 2015-2017: They did what??</h3>
            <p>After getting new management, having seasoned vets and acquiring new breakout stars, the Bucks moved up to the 6th slot in the Eastern Conference 2014-2015 season after 54 point blowout from Chicago Bulls. They go on to sign Greg Monroe and have an okay season. Following the 2016-2016 season, the Bucks pick up Malcolm Brogdon in the draft and trade Michael Carter-williams for Tony Snell. All for Jabari Parker to tear his ACL again in February 2017. This leads to them falling to the Raptors in six games and John Hammond leaving and Jon Horst promoting. To top it off, the Bucks get Eric Bledsoe for Greg Monroe, their 1st round pick <em>AND</em> 2nd round pick for the upcoming draft.</p>
